Data Science Intern Assignment
Project Overview
This project involves solving three key tasks as part of the Data Science Intern assignment:
1.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze the provided datasets to derive insights into customer behavior, product performance, and transaction trends.
2.	Lookalike Model: Recommend 3 similar customers for the first 20 customers based on their profiles and transaction history.
3.	Customer Segmentation: Segment customers into clusters based on their profiles and transaction patterns, and evaluate the clustering results using metrics like the Davies-Bouldin Index.

Tasks Breakdown
Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
•	Objective: Derive insights from customer, product, and transaction data.
•	Key Deliverables: 
o	Python script (Harshitha_Simhadri_EDA.py) for EDA.
o	PDF report (Harshitha_Simhadri_EDA.pdf) summarizing findings and visualizations.
Task 2: Lookalike Model
•	Objective: Build a model to recommend 3 similar customers for the first 20 customers based on their profiles and transaction history.
•	Key Deliverables: 
o	Python script (Harshitha_Simhadri_Lookalike.py).
o	CSV file (Harshitha_Simhadri_Lookalike.csv) containing recommendations.
Task 3: Customer Segmentation
•	Objective: Segment customers into clusters and evaluate clustering quality.
•	Key Deliverables: 
o	Python script (Harshitha_Simhadri_Clustering.py).
o	Report (Harshitha_Simhadri_Clustering.pdf) with clustering insights and metrics
